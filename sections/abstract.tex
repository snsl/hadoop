This work focuses on enabling effective data analytics on scaled-out
object storage systems. Typically, applications perform MapReduce
computations by first copying large amounts of data to a separate compute
cluster (i.e. a Hadoop cluster). However; this approach is not very efficient
considering that storage systems can host hundreds of
petabytes of data. Network bandwidth can be easily saturated and the
overall energy consumption would increase during large-scale data
transfer. Instead of moving data between remote clusters; we
propose the implementation of a data analytics layer
on an object-based storage cluster to perform in-place MapReduce
computation on existing data. The analytics layer is tied to the underlying
object store, utilizing its data redundancy and distribution policies across
the cluster. We implemented this approach with Ceph object storage system and
Hadoop, and conducted evaluations with various benchmarks. Performance evaluations
show that initial data copy performance is improved by up to 96\% and
the MapReduce performance is improved by up to 20\% compared to the stock Hadoop
implementation.
